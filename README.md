## Hey, I'm Zayd! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Software Developer at Vidyard and graduate student in AI. This profile is dedicated to my open-source work and research explorations.

Most of my private work is on a [different profile](https://github.com/Zayd-Waves/), but Iâ€™ll be adding more projects here as I continue contributing to open-source projects and explore areas of interest.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me diving into one of my many hobbies (I have way too many!). I love traveling and immersing myself in new cultures, picking up new languages along the way. Iâ€™m also a big fan of staying activeâ€”whether itâ€™s hitting the gym or going for long runs. And if thereâ€™s music playing, thereâ€™s a good chance Iâ€™m dancingâ€”whether you notice or not. ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate!
