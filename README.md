## Hey, I'm Zayd! 👋
I’m a Software Developer at Vidyard and graduate student in AI. This profile is dedicated to my open-source work and research explorations.

Most of my private work is on a [different profile](https://github.com/Zayd-Waves/), but I’ll be adding more projects here as I continue contributing to open-source projects and explore areas of interest. If you ever find yourself interested in reading my ramblings on various things, check out [my blog](https://scriptedjournal.com/).

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me diving into one of my many hobbies (I have way too many!). I love traveling and immersing myself in new cultures, picking up new languages along the way. I’m also a big fan of staying active - whether it’s hitting the gym or going for long runs. And if there’s music playing, there’s a good chance I’m dancing - whether you notice or not. 😎

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate!
